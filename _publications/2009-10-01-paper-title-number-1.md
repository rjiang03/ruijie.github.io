title: "On neural and dimensional collapse in supervised and unsupervised contrastive learning with hard negative sampling"
collection: Preprint
excerpt: 'Check our latest theoretical work! We present a unified optimal geometry for Supervised and Unsupervised Contrastive learning: The neural collapse! We proved it with a extremly simple way. Beyond that, we also discussed the connection between hard negative sampling and dimensional collapse.'
